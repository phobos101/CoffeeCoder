##What is CoffeeCoder
**CoffeeCoder** is a website for the hacking community to both teach and learn Coffeescript.

This is achieved with **short, modular lessons** that can be quickly completed.

Getting started with CoffeeCoder is super simple, once you have logged in, just head to the lessons area and choose a lesson that looks interesting, it will contain instructions and an interactive REPL window to enter your CoffeeScript code. Once you think you have entered the correct code, just hit the 'Run' link and you get instant feedback!

##Community Maintained
The great thing about CoffeeCoder is th it is community maintained. The goal is that at you can find what you want to learn really quickly, let's say you want to learn list comprehension, there may be 10+ lessons on this specific subject, and once you are comfortable with the topic, perhaps you think it could be explained better? CoffeeCoder allows you to then quickly write up your own lesson on that topic for others to see.

##The Future
Below is a list of things we want to add to CoffeeCoder!
* Adding a comment section below the output window to provide and see feedback.
* Rank lessons by number of subscriptions and completions.
* Sort the leaderboard to reward the most active members of the community.
* Add a search feature so users can quickly find topics they want to learn.
* Subscribe to an author so that people can get notified when they add new content.

##Contributing
I welcome contributions! I will shortly be adding a contributing file for more information.

##The Build
The CoffeeCoder front-end is built with HTML5 and CSS3 along with:
* Bootstrap 3
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* AngularJS
  * angular-jwt
  * angular-resource
  * angular-ui-router

I code on an Apple Macbook and Ubuntu with the Atom text editor.

##The API
The CoffeeCoder backend is stored on another repo and can be found [here!](https://github.com/phobos101/CoffeeCoder-API)
